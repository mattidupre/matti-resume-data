        I’m not your typical test-driven frontend engineer. I have over 15 years of experience in front-end design and development, backend systems engineering, and everything in between. I also have experience in working as a designer, a freelancer, a meetup organizer, and a company co-founder.

        My diverse skillset, growth mindset, and big-picture thinking help me bring developers together, build results, and write clean test-driven code that I am proud of.
